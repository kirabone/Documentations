      <p class="description">
        A platform that acts as a marketplace for projects and a networking
        platform for the developers who built them.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>The Problems We Have Discovered</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          There is no perfect platform to display projects in a way similar to
          Instagram posts.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no dedicated platform focused on collaborating with other
          serious developers.
        </li>
        <li>
          There is no single platform to explore a large number of projects for
          inspiration and reference.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h2>How Do We Solve This Problem?</h2>
      <p>
        We will build a platform named <b>MadeBy</b>, where developers can upload
        their projects as posts.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Posts</b> — Each post represents a project and includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Project link (mandatory)</li>
            <li>Project preview images (optional)</li>
            <li>Project preview video (optional)</li>
            <li>Project preview text (optional)</li>

            <li>Comment section (optional)</li>
            <li>Like / Dislike section (optional)</li>
            <li>
              Get Code button (optional — requires the developer to upload the
              code)
            </li>
            <li>
              Contributions (mandatory, at least for self) — allows adding other
              developers and describing their contributions to the project
            </li>
            <p>
              <b>NOTE:</b> The uploader of the project is not considered the
              owner of the project.
            </p>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Developer Account</b> — Each user account includes:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Skills list (skills are marked as "not verified" by default and
              can be verified using built-in tests or by uploading supporting
              certificates for external verification)
            </li>
            <li>
              Other platform links (GitHub, YouTube, portfolio, etc.)
            </li>
            <li>Follow button to follow developers</li>
            <li>
              Post list containing all projects, categorized as "solo" or
              "collab – collab name"
            </li>
            <li>Bio section</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Collab</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A group chat feature where developers can invite others to discuss
              project ideas and plans
            </li>
            <li>
              Invites appear in a separate collab section showing sent and
              received requests
            </li>
            <li>This feature functions mainly as a focused group chat</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Inbox</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A general chat feature allowing developers to message each other
              directly
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Core Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        Our core philosophy is to create a platform where developers can upload
        their projects, explore projects built by other developers, learn from
        them, and gain inspiration and references. Since the platform is
        niche-focused only on developers, every user on the platform is a
        developer, which increases the chances of finding suitable coding or
        development partners.
